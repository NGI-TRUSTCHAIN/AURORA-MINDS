# AURORA-MINDS
<h2>Introduction</h2>
AURORA MINDS represents a groundbreaking initiative, started from 15th of January 2024, aimed at addressing the need to early and accurately diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, aiming to improve the socio-economic landscape by enabling better education and support for children with ADHD, ultimately enhancing their life prospects, while prioritizing data privacy and security. In a landscape crowded with assistive technologies for ADHD, this project distinguishes itself by integrating robust privacy measures at its core. Existing ADHD assistive technologies often overlook privacy and security concerns, leaving users vulnerable to data risks and profiling. To counter these challenges, AURORA MINDS implements a multi-layered security framework, including Identity Management (IdM) and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). This approach enhances data security, strictly controls access to sensitive information, and ensures compliance with data privacy regulations.

The project leverages machine learning techniques such as federated learning and local differential privacy to protect sensitive user data during collection and analysis, aligning with GDPR requirements. Data will be pseudonymized and encrypted during storage and transfer. Consent mechanisms and access controls will be implemented to ensure data protection and privacy.
 <h2>The project</h2>
AURORA MINDS adopts a human-centric design approach, tailoring personal data collection from a child while s/he interacts with a serious tablet animation game to cater a unique ADHD risk assessment process.
The project benefits various stakeholders, including children, parents, educators, and clinicians. Children are examined through a specialized application supporting their behavioral unique requirements and independence. 

- Parents receive reassurance regarding data confidentiality, gaining insights into ADHD risk assessment and relevant information to provide better support.
- Clinicians benefit from enhanced diagnosis capabilities, aided by qualitative and quantitative measurements.
- Collaboration with educational institutions to enhance support for children with ADHD. Schools can use the project's assessments to better understand students' needs and tailor educational plans accordingly.

The system allows parents to register their child with ADHD by completing a questionnaire on behavior, education, and medical history. After registration, parents gain access to the Behavior Application, which collects behavioral data from children's interactions with ADHD-specific applications. This data is securely transferred to the Machine Learning Backend Server for analysis, with insights provided to clinicians via the Behavioral Party. Clinicians access relevant information for diagnosis and treatment planning. The server stores processed data securely, and users can request Attribute-Based Credentials for access. Access control is managed by the Behavioral Party, with tailored access for children, parents, and clinicians. An Application Portal offers information and links to system components, while a Virtual Identity Provider enables credential management and verification tokens issuance. The overall architecture of our system is illustrated below:

Access rights are carefully managed using the Privacy-ABCs (Privacy-Attribute-Based Credentials) approach, ensuring that each entity—child, parent, and clinician—receives appropriate access privileges.
By incorporating this proposal into the **TRUSTCHAIN** framework, **AURORA MINDS** elevates TRUSTCHAIN's reputation by exemplifying a steadfast commitment to data privacy and security. The emphasis on PETs and federated machine learning not only bolsters data privacy but also mitigates legal risks associated with data sharing, enhancing data quality for effective decision-making.

<h2>More Details</h2>
The main functionalities of the AURORA MINDS ecosystem include the following:

**Wallet  Application**
- Credential Storage: Stores issued credentials securely.
- Interactions: Facilitates interactions with the Behavioral Machine Learning Backend server.
- Privacy-ABCs Management: Issues and verifies Privacy-Attribute-Based Credentials to users.
- Compliance: Aligns with W3C-DID, W3C-VC standards, and European digital identity regulations.
- Data Security: Ensures credentials are securely stored and transmitted.

**ADHD Diagnosis**
- Credential Issuing: Serves as the primary issuer of credentials.
- Parameter Storage: Stores system parameters in a public repository for accessibility.
- Federated Learning: Decentralizes the personal data required for machine learning and establishes a connection for federated learning between the device and server
- Privacy-ABCs: Supports the issuance of Privacy-Attribute-Based Credentials.

**Databases**
- Data Storage: Stores children's collected data in encrypted form.
- Secure Recording: Utilizes Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) for secure and immutable record-keeping.

<h1>Possible integration with OC1 projects</h1>

- ConInSe, an innovative framework designed for privacy-centric data management. Built on Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles provide to users a robust and scalable approach to managing consent in a distributed and asynchronous manner.
- CreatorCredentials project is dedicated to developing a user-centric digital identity management framework.
- DidRoom, an open-source multiplatform and multifunctional Identity DID/SSI wallet, compliant with the W3C-DID and W3C-VC standards and with the current “The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework” (EUDI – ARF, version 1.0.0 from January 2023) which is the technical core of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation.
  
<h1>Possible integration with OC2 projects</h1>

- ProvenAI (Provenance in AI) could be integrating into our project enhancing data governance and privacy by ensuring traceability and accountability for every piece of information used within our system, aligning seamlessly with our commitment to ethical AI development and user empowerment.
- GUEDHS (Data Governance and User privacy envisioning an EHDS pilot deployment) project focuses on securely sharing and reusing health data while respecting privacy and enforcing data control. Leveraging federated learning and cybersecurity tools, GUEDHS facilitates fast deployment of a Federated Network, enabling data custodians to manage permissions and monitor data usage for respiratory infections research.
